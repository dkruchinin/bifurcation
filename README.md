# bifurcation

Well, as it frequently happens I was procrastinating by reading [Chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science) book (brilliant btw, can highly recommend), where I stumbled upon a [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map) reccurence relation leading to chaotic behavior and a [bifurcation diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_diagram), a fractal-like map manifisting itself as a way to visualise possible values of the logistic map reccurence. Long story short, my procrastination gently guided me to making a few interactive graphs for playing  around with different parameters and zooming levels. Enjoy.
